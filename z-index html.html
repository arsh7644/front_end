Trees are food for man and all herbivorous animals. The roots, stems, leaves, flowers, fruits and seeds of trees may be edible. Trees are also home to many wildlife species. Animals seek the shade and shelter of trees. Birds build their nests in trees. Reptiles and insects also live in trees.

Trees help in binding the soil. Trees and forests also play a role in maintaining the hydrological cycle and rainfall patterns. Trees are Nature’s bounty. We must not cut down trees. We must protect trees, and help grow more trees.rees give us many benefits. Trees are the green cover of the planet. Trees need water, sunshine and air to grow. The process of photosynthesis that occurs in trees, that helps them grow, uses oxygen and gives out carbon-dioxide. Thus, they contribute to the oxygen in the air that we need to breathe to stay alive. They also use up the carbon-dioxide that is present in the air, and thus prevent the accumulation of the greenhouse gas that leads to global warming and climate change.When seeds and saplings are planted and grow into trees, they make a place greener and more beautiful. Attractive, colourful and sweet-smelling flowers bloom on trees. Trees may grow to be very tall, or may be short in height.

Trees provide shade. They are also home to many animals, birds, reptiles and insects. Animals run up trees to save themselves from predators. Birds build their nests in trees. Butterflies and bees also visit the flowers that bloom on a tree.
